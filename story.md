# Escape at the Museum 

## Story Premise

   Our game will be a intense mystery thriller, players will need nerves of steel and quick wit. The character will awaken in an a dark non-descript location, with lots of questions but no answers. The setting will be a museum after hours, a castle with gothic architecture. The character will be faced with a series of puzzels, in order to gain their freedom, encouraged by NPCs, in the other exibits. The character must hurry, as there is evidence that they are not alone in the museum and what they are trapped with may not be human.

   The twist is that, the character is apart of the museum theirself, and they are misguided through out. There may be different endings depending on user choices. However, if the user simply follows the NPCs and the puzzels they will be revealed to be a wax figure and melt upon escaping in the morning.
