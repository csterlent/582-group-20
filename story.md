# Escape at the Museum 

## Story Premise

   Our game will be a intense mystery thriller, players will need nerves of steel and quick wit. The character will awaken in an a dark non-descript location, with lots of questions but no answers. The setting will be a museum after hours, a castle with gothic architecture. The character will be faced with a series of puzzels, in order to gain their freedom, encouraged by NPCs, in the other exibits. The character must hurry, as there is evidence that they are not alone in the museum and what they are trapped with may not be human.

   The twist is that, the character is apart of the museum theirself, and they are misguided through out. There may be different endings depending on user choices. However, if the user simply follows the NPCs and the puzzels they will be revealed to be a wax figure and melt upon escaping in the morning. 

The following are in no particular order

eddie: Im not really sure how to get these bars open, but im sure you can figure something out if you poke around a bit.

### player focuses on in ancient greece.
eddie: Welcome to the workshop of the great archimedes, one of the greatest human minds ever. You can see him stand proudly in the back of the room by his work bench. 

hmmm, you need to turn on the power, archimedes always did want to light up the world, im sure he'll apreciate it when he gets back.

eddie: that is one of his famous reflecting dishes, 

eddie: youve found the hammer of archimedes!

eddie: maybe it will work on the bars

eddie: hahahahaha, im sorry i really thought that would work. 


### player focuses on the art gallery.
eddie: excellent taste, welcome to the gallery. shall we check out our one of a kind masterpieces. Here we have an original, picaso, rembrant, mickle angelo, raphael, donatello, and even their leader in blue leonardo. 

eddie: all pale in comparison to the jewl of our gallery, 'the scholar at work', as you can see here he is always hard at work. His diligence and determination are known for drawing people in. 

eddie: oh hmm, i dont know where he is, anyways ill be right dont get stuck.

eddie: you dont even know if there is a code, how do you know I want messing with you from the start.
